// const fetchBalances(addresses: string[]): Promise<number[]> {
//    // addresses can contain thousands of addresses
//    const groupRunner = new GroupRunner(10)
//    const getBalance = groupRunner.wrapFunction(fetchBalance)

// Once the size has been reached, we wait for all previous tasks to finish
// before running the new task.
// Alternatively, we could run more tasks as soon as some (rather than all)
// tasks have finished, to make progress sooner, but the former is what's
// currently used in multiple places in the external-adapters-js repo so we
